a=5
b=4
print(a&b) #pronounced as AND
'''
it takes binary numbers of above
  a=0101
  b=0100
a&b=0100    # if both are 1 thenn 1 otherwise 0 
'''
print(a|b) #pronounced as OR
'''
same this also takes binary number
but here # if both are 0 then 0 otherwise 1
'''
print(a^b) #pronounced as XOR
'''
same as above but here
# if both are same then gives 0 otherwise 1
'''
print(~a) #pronounced as NOT(compliment)
'''
~a=-(a+1)
but inside the program it works different
'''
print(a<<2) #pronounced as left swift
'''
x<<n=x*(2**n) x multiplied with 2 power n
'''
print(a>>2) #pronounced as Right swift
'''
x>>n=x/(2**n) x divided by  2 power n
